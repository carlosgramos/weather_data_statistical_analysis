# Lake Pend Oreille

This is a statistical analysis problem solved in Ruby. The goal is to calculate the mean and
median of live US Navy weather data from Lake Pen Oreille in Idaho. The exercise was provided
by Kevin Skoglund at Lynda.com.

In statistics, Mean and Median are used to estimate central tendency.
  
*  **The Mean or average** is probably the most commonly used method of describing central tendency. To compute the mean all you do is add up all the values and divide by the number of values.
* **The Median** is the score found at the exact middle of the set of values. One way to compute the median is to list all scores in numerical order, and then locate the score in the center of the sample.
